<br>
<div class="docu">
<p>In astrology, the houses are the comic version of a crystal ball-only way more legit.There are 12 houses,
    each representing a key part of life from health to money to relationships and everything in between.
    Consider the wheel of houses as map in the sky, with planets constantly moving from house to house.
    When you’re born, each planet was in a certain house-and those houses can be seen in your birth chart.
    The houses are determined by the time you were born, not just the date, so you might need to text your 
    parents to find this out.</p>
    <p>The  locations of the planets at the moment of your birth(or throughout your life) can give you valuable 
    insights-so if Jupiter (the planet of luck) was in your second house (which rules finances) right when you
    were born, making money will likely come easy to you.</p>
    <p>Your Rising sign—the zodiac sign that was on the horizon at the moment you were born, also called your
    Ascendant—marks your 1st house, and astrologers work counterclockwise from there. When you look at your
    birth chart, you might notice that you have multiple planets in certain houses, while other houses are
    totally empty. That’s normal—and it all plays a role in what makes your personality and life path unique.</p>

<div class="elementet img">
<img src="images/houseW.png" alt="HouseWheel"></div>




<div class="kuti"></div>
<div class="body-tip"><p>1st House</p></div>
<div class="docu">
<p>This governs what you look like and how you present yourself to the world. It’s all about
   how others see you (this is also known as your Rising sign or Ascendant). First house = 
   first impressions—makes sense, right? It also covers other “firsts,” like new beginnings 
   and leadership. It’s ruled by Aries.</p></div>
<br>

<div class="kuti"></div>
<div class="body-tip"><p>2nd house</p></div>
<div class="docu">
<p>Where you’ll find the things you value on a practical level, like money (both your potential
   to make it and how you relate to it), and your general relationship to your stuff. It also
   covers self-esteem and your immediate physical environment. It’s ruled by Taurus.</p></div>
<br>


<div class="kuti"></div>
<div class="body-tip"><p>3rd house</p></div>
<div class="docu">
<p>Lots going on here: your attitude, intellect, and communication. (And communication includes
   talking, texting, emailing, Instagram Stories, etc.) Friends, siblings, and neighbors too.
   Also, sort of randomly: early education. It’s ruled by Gemini.</p></div>
<br>


<div class="kuti"></div>
<div class="body-tip"><p>4th house</p></div>
<div class="docu">
<p>This is about your home and your family—both the one you come from and the one you may someday create.
    It also includes homey things like privacy and security. It’s ruled by Cancer.</p></div>
<br>


<div class="kuti"></div>
<div class="body-tip"><p>5th house</p></div>
<div class="docu">
<p>Watch out: This house is all about love affairs, creativity, fertility, dating, romance, fun,
   attention, and ~drama~. (Who’s sweating?) It’s ruled by Leo.</p></div>
<br>


<div class="kuti"></div>
<div class="body-tip"><p>6th house</p></div>
<div class="docu">
<p>It rules the things you do every day (even granular stuff like brushing your teeth and petting your pup)—your
   daily routine and your schedule. This is also where you can see your physical health and habits. It’s ruled by
   Virgo.</p></div>
<br>


<div class="kuti"></div>
<div class="body-tip"><p>7th house</p></div>
<div class="docu">
<p>Call up your crew. Here, you’ll find partnerships—who you like and how you relate to others—your BFF, your life
   partner, your frenemies, and your straight-up enemies. It also covers stuff related to partnerships of any kind,
   like marriage contracts or business deals. It’s ruled by Libra.</p></div>
<br>


<div class="kuti"></div>
<div class="body-tip"><p>8th house</p></div>
<div class="docu">
<p>Another one with A Lot going on: bigger money stuff like inheritances, taxes, and debt. Fun! Also, completely 
   unrelated. And how you feel about death. And birth too! Casual. It’s ruled by Scorpio.</p></div>
<br>


<div class="kuti"></div>
<div class="body-tip"><p>9th house</p></div>
<div class="docu">
<p>Welcome to higher learning, ethics, and vision. Here’s where your view of the world is shaped. For this reason,
   it’s also all about international travel—and also the ~travel of the mind~, like learning a foreign language or
   exploring religion and philosophy. It’s ruled by Sagittarius.</p></div>
<br>


<div class="kuti"></div>
<div class="body-tip"><p>10th house</p></div>
<div class="docu">
<p>NBD, just your life calling—your purpose and your career are based here. It’s also the highest point in the
   chart, where you’ll want to be recognized for your achievements—think honors, awards, international fame, a blue
   check on Instagram, you get the deal. It’s ruled by Capricorn.</p></div>
<br>


<div class="kuti"></div>
<div class="body-tip"><p>11th house</p></div>
<div class="docu">
<p>Your less emo social connections live here alongside humanitarian concerns—and technology. Look to the 11th
   for revolution, evolution, and the organizing it takes to get there. It’s ruled by Aquarius.</p></div>
<br>


<div class="kuti"></div>
<div class="body-tip"><p>12th house</p></div>
<div class="docu">
<p>PSA: So much of the stuff that gets caught in your blind spots stems from this house, which governs
 mental and spiritual health and your earliest developmental experiences. It’s also all about the imagination
 and the arts as well as the concept of endings. It’s ruled by Pisces.</p></div>
