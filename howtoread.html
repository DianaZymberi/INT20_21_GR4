                <h1>How to read Tarot Cards</h1>
            </div>
            <p>After I have jazzed up the deck, I proceed with the type of intuitive reading that I offer my clients. As I
                am a
                go-big or go-home type of girl, I don’t use just one deck. On any given day I have ten to twenty decks of
                different cards mixed in the spread I use in my work. The cards you will find in my stack range from mantra
                cards and spirit animal cards, to goddess cards and traditional Rider-Waite style decks. I like to keep
                things
                interesting and it’s fun to have a dynamic palette of messages and images.</p>
            <p>Once a client has chosen the number of cards that feels right, we lay out their personal visual narrative and
                begin the reading. In a session with me you can pick as many cards as you want—however, what you pick you
                keep.
                Why do I do this? One, it helps my clients flex their intuitive muscle by picking what they need to hear
                about
                that day. One hundred times out of one hundred, a client picks a card and looks at it, and it immediately
                resonates with a subject matter we discussed prior to picking a card.</p>
            <p>Following the reading, I send my clients home with Shamanic Mystical Homework: I ask that a client takes all
                the
                cards they received in a session and put them somewhere that is personal and within their everyday sphere,
                like
                an altar, bathroom mirror, or journal. I ask them to look at the cards every once in awhile and have a gut
                check
                on how the process is going.</p>
            <p>Once you feel like you have worked through the energy of the cards, it’s time to part ways. How? I ask that
                you
                say goodbye to your personal story around the card and thank it for all the teachings, lessons, and
                blessings it
                has shown you. In shamanism, you are always working with the elements to help heal and shift energy. We will
                work with the elements of air, fire, or water in this exercise. I ask that you burn, bury, or set the card
                to
                sea. What does this do? We must look at ourselves like a house or container. If we want to bring new energy
                in,
                we must first make room by letting go of old energy. There is only so much room in our container, right?
                Since
                everything starts at an energetic level before it becomes mental, physical, or emotional, we are
                kick-starting
                the process by saying goodbye and thank you to those old stories, habits, or lessons that are no longer
                serving
                where we are now and where we are headed. It’s exactly like spring cleaning your closet. You don’t want to
                hold
                onto clothes that no longer fit you, represent your career path, or have holes in them.
                <strong>HOT TIP:</strong> A great time to burn, bury, or set cards to sea is at the full moon, when we
                release
                energy that no longer serves us.
            </p>
            <p>(If you choose to do my method you will eventually need to buy more tarot cards or a completely new deck.
                That is
                your personal preference. I am constantly refilling my stack as I use them in sessions every day.)
