                <h1>How to read Tarot Cards</h1>
            </div>
            <p>
                Learning how to use tarot requires a strong mix of intuition and familiarity with the symbols of the tarot.
                There is no right way to do it, and eventually everyone develops their own technique that they are comfortable with.
                We’ll go through a step by step process to get you started reading your cards in no time.</p>
            <p>
                There are many decks available, each with their own unique set of symbols and systems. You’ll have to create stories
                using the symbols of the deck in your reading, so choosing a deck whose artwork resonates with you is important. The
                most common deck and a great way to start is the Rider-Waite deck. There are however a myriad of options to choose from,
                but we’ve created a minimalist deck which makes reading somewhat simpler.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tarot spreads give you a structure in which you can explore your questions. Each position in the spread reflects an
                aspect of your question to consider. You don’t have to use them for every reading, but it’s a nice way to get started
                while you learn about the cards. One of the simplest readings you can use to familiarize yourself with the cards is the
                past, present, future spread. Take the top card from your shuffled deck, and reveal them one by one, left to right.
            </p>

            <h2>Get a First Impression of your Reading</h2>
            <p>Before delving into the individual card meanings, scan your cards and absorb what your reactions to the images are.
            Start to consider things like emotions, feelings, objects and symbols, and color - if there are any. What is your
            immediate reaction to these things? Be aware of this as you continue through the spread.</p>
            <p>Rituals are an important way we process events, and even if you’re skeptical, the act of following a ritual and treating
            your cards with respect and significance can be change how we perceive the world (and transform it). After you allow
            your reading to process, be grateful, clear your cards, and make sure to store it in safe and secure location.</p>
            <p>With time, you’ll be able to be more confident in reading. And as you encounter the cards, you’ll start to also notice
            systems and patterns in how their meanings are set up. For example, how the suits of the minor arcana relate to each
            other, and how the major arcana tells a story. All these things are beneficial in helping guide you through readings.</p>

        Tarot is one of the most popular divination practices, and though occultists have been drawing the allegorical cards for
        centuries, illustrated decks are now popping up all over. The intrinsic aestheticism of this ancient art has revitalized
        interest in tarot, making it a social media favorite — there's now even such a thing as emoji tarot.
        
        Despite its ubiquity, though, tarot can still seem elusive and confusing. What exactly is tarot? What do the cards mean
        and how are they used? Don't fret: The tarot fundamentals are easy to understand. Here's what every beginner should know
        about the history of tarot, as well as tips and tricks for kick-starting your unique practice.
        Surprisingly, tarot is a relatively modern craft. Though tarot decks date back to the 1400s, pictorial cards were
        originally used for games rather than prediction. Cartomancy, or fortune-telling through the use of playing cards,
        actually wasn't developed until 1785, when French occultist Jean-Baptiste Alliette — known by his pseudonym, Etteilla,
        the inversion of his surname — created comprehensive links between illustrated cards, astrology, and ancient Egyptian
        lore.
        
        Over the next century, mystics and philosophers continued to expand the role of tarot. In the late 1890s, several
        London-based occultists formed the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, one of the groups responsible for the modern
        magical revival. Two of the group's founders, husband and wife MacGregor and Moina Maters, wrote a manual that detailed
        tarot's symbolic power, entitled Book T.
        In 1909, Arthur Edward Waite and Pamela Colman Smith designed and published a tarot deck loosely based on the teachings
        of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. This timeless deck is commonly known as the Rider-Waite deck and is still the
        most popular tarot variant for both beginner and professional card readers. In 1943, occultist Aleister Crowley (the
        self-declared nemesis of Arthur Edward Waite) and Lady Frieda Harris published their own interpretation of the Hermetic
        Order of the Golden Dawn's tarot. Their Thoth deck, named after the Egyptian god of alphabets, incorporates specific
        astrological symbolism into each card, linking the divination practice to the cosmos.
        There is no shortage of stunning, dynamic tarot decks. Since the mid-twentieth century, hundreds — if not thousands — of
        beautiful decks have been published. The Tarot de Marseille deck is an elegant reproduction of a classic French deck;
        the Motherpeace deck perfectly captures the ethereal spirit of the 1970s; the Black Power deck spotlights famous black
        luminaries.
        Some tarot readers believe that your first deck should be gifted to you. While everyone loves presents, there is nothing
        more valuable rewarding yourself with the magic of divination, so I say you should relish the opportunity to choose your
        first deck. With so many enchanting options available, the most important variable is your unique connection to the
        cards.

        <div class="right">
        Whether you are shopping online or in-person, observe your emotions as you browse different tarot decks. Does the one
        you're considering make you feel excited? Wary? Confused? Trust your intuition: Your careful consideration will
        ultimately guide your interpretation of the cards. Explore the imagery: Are you enchanted by classical or modern
        representations? Note the symbols: Are they enticing? Remember, there is no hierarchy of tarot decks, so be sure to
        choose whichever deck truly tantalizes your soul.

        Let's talk about the structure of the deck and the meanings of its cards. Any magical practice — tarot, astrology, or
        spell work — is based on the Hermetic axiom "as above, so below." In other words, the macrocosm of the cosmos is
        reflected in the microcosm of individual experience. Accordingly, the entire universe exists within a tarot deck, with
        each card representing a person, place, or event. These symbols are depicted in both the Major Arcana cards, which speak
        to greater secrets, and the Minor Arcana cards, which speak to lesser secrets.

        The Major Arcana cards represent monumental, groundbreaking influences. They punctuate our journeys and each stands
        alone as a powerful message, representing life-changing motions that define the beginnings or ends of cycles. These
        dynamic cards appear during major transitions, signaling distinctive moments of transformation. The cards are numbered
        to represent stations within our greater journey through life; their chronological order reveals the passing of time.
        The Minor Arcana cards, on the other hand, reflect everyday matters. These cards showcase ordinary people engaging in
        mundane activities, such as dancing, drinking, sleeping, or quarreling. They suggest action that is triggered by human
        behaviors and appear during gentle transitions that may be temporary or have only minor influence.

        The Minor Arcana cards are broken up into four suits, each containing ten numbered cards and four court cards. In the
        Minor Arcana, the card's number reveals the stage of an event: The ace card represents the beginning, while the 10
        symbolizes the end. Similarly, the progression of the court cards demonstrates our understanding of circumstances on an
        individual level, representing either personality types or actual people. The Page (or Princess, in some decks), Knight,
        Queen, and King interpret circumstances with increasing levels of understanding and wisdom.

        The suits (Wands, Pentacles, Swords, and Cups) correspond to their own unique areas of life and astrological elements.
        Wands symbolize passion and inspiration (corresponding with the fire element), Pentacles represent money and physical
        realities (corresponding with the earth element), Swords depict intellectual intrigues (corresponding with the air
        element), and Cups illustrate emotional matters (corresponding with the water element). These suits reveal which spheres
        of influence are being activated, offering guidance on how to best manage any circumstances at hand.
